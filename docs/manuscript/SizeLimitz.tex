\begin{abstract}
	Harvesting fish is inherently a size-selective process where faster growing individuals recruit to fishing gear at younger ages.  As a consequence of size-selective fishing, faster growing individuals in a given cohort are subject to higher fishing mortality rates than slower growing individuals.  This results in a reduction in the mean size-at-age relative to an unfished population that exhibits the same growth rate.  Limits on the size of fish that can be retained in the fishery can protect spawning biomass, if and only if, release mortality rates are very low.  Release mortality is the fraction of individuals that die after capture and release.  If the release mortality rates are substantially greater than 0, limiting the legal size range could have a negative impact on future yield and spawning biomass if fishing mortality rates are sufficiently high.   Cumulative effects of size-selective fishing are amplified if release mortality rates are high and the minimum size limit is much greater than the size-at-entry to the fishery.  In addition to discards from the directed fishery, accounting for discards associated with non-directed fisheries also lowers estimates of optimal fishing mortality rates.  If bycatch mortality does not scale with overall population size (i.e., a constant amount of bycatch each year), then optimal harvest rates in the directed fishery must be reduced further to account for depensatory mortality rates in non-directed fisheries.
